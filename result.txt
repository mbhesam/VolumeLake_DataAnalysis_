*** Solution 1 ***
volume of pool Beta is: 7 Mio.m³
*** Solution 2 ***
time of pumping and turbining in UHPP & plot volumestime of pumping: 9.0 untill 12.0
time of pumping: 14.0 untill 18.0
time of pumping: 21.0 untill 3
time of turbining: 5.0 untill 9.0
time of turbining: 12.0 untill 14.0
time of turbining: 18.0 untill 21.0

*** Solution 3 ***
inflow/outflow of Pool Beta
*** Solution 4 ***
pump storage volume in lake is 7 Mio.m³
*** Solution 5 ***
maximum operational water level in reservoir is 930 m.a.s.l
*** Solution 6 ***
bottom outlet is located at 895 m.a.s.l
*** Solution 7 ***
annual storage volume of reservoir is volume of reservoir without dead volume and pump storage:  50 Mio.m³
*** Solution 8 ***
Maximum Fall Head for UHPP happens when Upper Reservoir in its maximum level AND Lake Alpha in its minimum level. This happens at the end of August, 3 - 5 o`clockDelta h: 311.0 mMinimum Fall Head for UHPP happens when Upper Reservoir in its minimum level AND Lake Alpha in its maximum level. This happens at the end of April, 9 o´clockDelta h: 278.0 m
*** Solution 9 ***
Between the start of May and the end of August, Lake Alpha Volume goes from Maximum Operational Volume to Minimum Operational Volume,And since there are 2 outflow (to LHPP and to Alphabeta Creek), we can say turbine discharge in the LHPP has 7.5 m³/s'MonthVolume' object has no attribute 'plot_All'
